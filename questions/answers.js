Hi Marissa, I'm sorry to hear your frustrations regarding our recently updated dashboard design.
Hopefully I can help alleviate that! From your navigation bar, you can click on the dropdown button
next to your account icon. Click settings, and then click 'Applications' on the Organization settings page.

This will show a comprehensive list of all existing indices. To the right of each index, the option to
delete and/or rename them is one click away.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to reach out, hope this helps!

Thanks,

Alwyn Grant

Good afternoon, Carrie. Thank you for reaching out, we definitely want to get this resolved
as soon as possible! From the details in your original email, it appears there are some Records
that may be larger than the threshold governed by your account plan. Algolia limits the size of records
for performance related reasons.

Outside of upgrading your current plan, you can also partition your records into smaller ones,
if the use case allows for it. Please refer to our how-to guide on indexing long documents list below.

Additionally, if you'd like, we can also set up a call today to go over how to handle this issue depending
on your specific case. Please let me know if this is something you'd like at your earliest convenience.


Thanks,

Alwyn Grant

Hi, Marc! Hope all is well. Upon immediate inspection, it looks like you might be missing some
dependencies. This appears to be unrelated to any Algolia products as far as I can tell. If after checking your
dependencies the issue still persists and you feel this may be related to an Algolia product, please
provide some additional information and I can definitely look into it!

Thanks,

Alwyn Grant
